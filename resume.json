        "Refactored the application database schema (~6 tables, ~6 views) from update-driven to event-driven so we could better measure customer impact.",
        "From ideation to implementation, introduced a feature to measure customer impact: as a recurring job, search google for our customers' businesses and check the search results for fuzzy matches of customer-identifying information. This involved using Google's custom search engine API, parsing the JSON, and using the Levenshtein algorithm to find closest matches to specified customer business parameters (e.g. name and zip). I've pasted a link to a small, fun open source contribution that resulted from this work.",
			  "Wep-API-related engineering: writing request.js-based clients, processing JSON, ad-hoc analysis of 3rd party partner data (curl + jq and then dumping that data to postgres to perform queries across our data & partner data).

My contributions were primarily as an individual feature contributor. My greatest isolated contribution was this experience for Social Media Marketing World 2015: https://www.pagemodo.com/smmw15. This was a vertical slice of work on the stack - wiring up models and controllers, the twitter integration, setting up a backbone app for the image carousel, etc. The \"designer\" that pops open if you click on a design already existed, I just ported it into this experience. I also did not do the html/css on the linked page. My other main contributions during this time included work on pagemodo's teams feature and some work with Apache SOLR to improve our content recommendation.",

My main contribution was a fault-tolerant script to migrate tree-subsets of records (order of magnitude, ~100k) from a legacy database with Latin1 encoding to a new databases with UTF8 encoding. A script existed at the time but it was shown to result in data corruption (it did an inconsistently shallow/deep copy) and also could take up to a day or two to run. The new script would run in minutes to hours. The end result could be considered an ETL implemented in Ruby and Rails and was used to migrate all existing federal agencies' data to the new database.",
